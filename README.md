## Use
- Select the field (column) you would like to SEARCH in and start typing to search.
- Alternatively, you may FILTER the results by clicking on a letter. EYP will find all rows whose data in the selected field (ex. TITLE) begins with that letter.
- SORT by simplying clicking on the title of the column. Alternates between ascending and descending.

# TODOs
- Clear filter button.
- Different filter options depending on type of field chosen.
- Move filter options to component. Place component next to field name.
- Filtered column is highlighted.
- Depict the filtered method.
- Stickiness of footer.
- Responsive/Stackable table for smaller screens.
- Dark mode.
